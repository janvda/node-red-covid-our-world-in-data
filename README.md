node-red-covid-our-world-in-data
================================

This node-red flow provides a simple dashboard that allows to compare the percentage of confirmed cases (with respect to the tests performed) over time between 2 countries.

This is based on the [github COVID-19 data set](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) maintained by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)

Note that the data set is not containing the number of tests performed for all countries.
